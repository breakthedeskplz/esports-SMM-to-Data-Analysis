My first small project that I finished while learning Excel via a YouTube course "Excel for Data Analytics - Full Course for Beginners" by Luke Barousse. 

The purpose of the project was to build an interactive visual dashboard that you can manipulate by altering job titles, countries and job types.

Data and guidance was provided by Luke and I was following his steps to replicate it.
